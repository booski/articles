Alltså det här med malware är ändå väldigt intressant. Jag läser nu om en ny linux-malware som tydligen är innovativ bla för att den använder "legitima hosting-tjänster" för sina kontrollservrar. Det är ett mönster jag sett återkomma regelbundet under de senaste åren - säkerhetsforskare hittar en ny malware och det som beskrivs som nytt är att den på något sätt använder verktyg som annars anses legitima, vilket gör den svårare att upptäcka via automatisk analys.

Det generella intrycket jag fått genom åren är att det är supertrivialt att bygga malware som är nästan omöjlig att upptäcka

Watching malware reporting over the last decade or so has been
fascinating. Time and again new malware is analyzed and the major
innovations fall into a few buckets:
 * In-memory malware as opposed to file-based malware
 * Malware using tools already present on the host as opposed to bringing
their own
 * Command and control servers hosted by "legitimate" providers as opposed
to known "bulletproof" or otherwise malicious providers
 * Pulling resources from [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/)


To me as a lowly sysadmin all these things seem like absolute no-brainers
to do if I were to build some malware, so the treatment of these
approaches as innovative keeps surprising and fascinating me.

I can't imagine being alone in viewing these things as more or less being
starting points for writing malware as opposed to being major innovations
in the field, so what would that imply for the malware landscape? Some
pretty scary things, but also some points of relief.

Firstly, given the number of people in the world, the number of insecure
devices, the probability of getting caught, and the plethora of potential
uses for an infected device, I believe the amount and variety of malware
floating around the internet to be absolutely mind-boggling. We also
should remember the very real cost of tools like Metasploit being freely
available - this gives people like me, who would be at a complete loss
as to how to gain a foothold on some random device, ready-made solutions
to infect devices for whatever purpose I might want.

There is also very little reason to believe that any significant portion of malware is known to anyone besides the authors/users of said malware. A common thread through the reporting around these "innovative" malware approaches is that they are hard to detect via automatic tools, and once again the numbers are on the side of the attacker. For example, of all the consumer routers in the world, how many of them are being monitored for malware in any capacity at all? Probably only an absolutely miniscule fraction.
