Working on a concept for a game. A cross between RimWorld and Dwarf
Fortress (among other games), it should be a very open game experience
both in terms of gameplay and player choice but also in terms of what
type of game unfolds.

It should be possible to play the game as an unmanned probe, a single
adventurer, a small crew of shipmates, or an entire civilization, or any
size in between. No framerate guarantees ;)

Specific thoughts:  
 * Each encounter (anything from scanning space debris to landing on a
planet) causes the world generator to fill in more of the world. History
is generated as needed and integrated with previously generated lore
(your sources may not be honest or impartial though).

 * Ships should be buildable in 3d, with the option of having more than
   one level.

 * Gravity should be orientable whichever way by use of some item.
   Rotational gravity should also be possible.

 * It should be possible to create subsidiary craft using the exact same
   rules as the main ship, only limited in (initial) size by the
   construction facilities.

 * The ship generator will be absolutely key to the setting - most events
   will be emergent from the interactions between different ships and
   their properties.

 * Power distribution will probably be an important mechanic. Consider
   possible grid management options.
