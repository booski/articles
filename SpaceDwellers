Working on a concept for a game. A cross between RimWorld and Dwarf
Fortress (among other games), it should be a very open game experience
both in terms of gameplay and player choice but also in terms of what
type of game unfolds.

It should be possible to play the game as an unmanned probe, a single
adventurer, a small crew of shipmates, or (in principle at least) an
entire civilization, or any size in between. No framerate guarantees ;)

Specific thoughts:

 * Each encounter (anything from scanning space debris to landing on a
   planet) causes the world generator to fill in more of the world.
   History is generated as needed and integrated with previously
   generated lore (your sources may not be honest or impartial though).

 * Ships should be buildable in 3d, with the option of having more than
   one level.

 * Gravity should be orientable whichever way by use of some item.
   Rotational gravity should also be possible.

 * It should be possible to create subsidiary craft using the exact same
   rules as the main ship, only limited in (initial) size by the
   construction facilities.

 * The ship generator will be absolutely key to the setting - most events
   will be emergent from the interactions between different ships and
   their properties.

 * Power distribution will probably be an important mechanic. Consider
   possible grid management options.

Some ship generation BNF:

      # Definitions
      Ship := Module+

      Module := Propulsion
                Communications
                Power plant
                Life support
                Food
                Sleep
                AI core
                Weapons
                Control chair


      # Relations ( Provider -> Provides; Dependent <- Needs )
      Propulsion <- Power plant
                 <- Controls

      Communications <- Power

      Power plant -> Power

      Air supply <- Power

      Life support <- Air supply

      Food <- Kitchen inside Life suport
           <- Power

      Sleep <- Bed inside Life support

      AI core -> Controls
              <- Power

      Weapons <- Controls

      Control chair -> Controls
                    <- Air supply

      Cryocasket <- Bed
                 <- Power x2

      # Example ship types
      One-shot probe := Power plant, Communications

      Unmanned scout := Power plant x3, Propulsion, Communications, AI core

      Fighter := Power plant x7, Propulsion x3, Weapons x2,
                 Control chair, Air supply

      Unarmed singleship := Power plant x5, Propulsion x2, Control chair, Air supply,
                            Communications, Life support x3, Sleep, Food

      Cryogenic passenger liner := Power plant x210, Propulsion x16, Communications,
                                   AI core, Cryocasket x96 (Life support, Sleep, Power x2)
